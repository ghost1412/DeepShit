      "<strong>BENGALURU</strong> :\n",
      "Nestaway Technologies, which provides homes on rent, is struggling to refund security deposits to the tenants, even after they vacated the premises and returned to their hometowns amid coronavirus outbreak.</p>, <p>Some of occupants have also moved consumer courts alleging fraud and extortion against the Bengaluru-based startup due to non-payment of their refundable security deposit.</p>, <p>At least six tenants that Mint spoke with said that the company failed to refund their money several weeks after vacating the premises. The occupants also alleged that in many cases, the company imposed hidden charges recovering the entire security deposit.</p>, <p>Most of the tenants who have not received the refund have now taken to social media and organized themselves on messaging apps like Telegram.</p>, <p>Sourabh Choudhary, a Nestaway tenant based in Mumbai said that he is yet to receive a deposit refund worth  <span class=\"webrupee\">₹</span>75,000 for his twin-sharing room that he vacated in March. Choudhary’s monthly rent was  <span class=\"webrupee\">₹</span>25,000 and he paid three month’s rent in security deposit when he moved to a Nestaway property in August 2019.</p>, <p>“On 24 March I left the property and gave my notice period which is 15 days, however, Nestaway had already disabled the option to move-out in the mobile app hence I left an email and informed customer care,\" Choudhary said.</p>, <p>He added that although he vacated the premises back in March, Nestaway failed to acknowledge it and sent invoices for rent payments for the months of May and June. In addition, Nestaway also imposed additional “utility charges\" for May and June and even charged Choudhary  <span class=\"webrupee\">₹</span>2,500 in late fees despite vacating the premises in March.</p>, <p>Siddhant Garg, a Bengaluru-based software engineer based said that Nestaway deleted his dashboard and past history of grievances as soon as he vacated the premises in June.</p>, <p>“I moved into a Nestaway property in February, 2019. I decided to vacate the house this June after the lockdown was lifted. After I raised a request to vacate on the app, it mentioned that I would be paid back deposit refunds of  <span class=\"webrupee\">₹</span>25,000 without deductions within 7 days, but this entire information was deleted from the dashboard the day after I moved out and I’m yet to receive any money,\" Garg said.</p>, <p>A Nestaway spokesperson said that the startup has seen a “surge in move-out cases\" in the last 3-4 months. To date, the startup claims to have solved around 3,000 move-out cases where the security deposit was pending.</p>, <p>The company added that there have been many instances of property damage found in inspections carried out by a third party and that it only charges tenants for the damage caused. There were also a few instances when tenants claimed to have moved-out but were found to be still staying in the property, the spokeswoman said.</p>, <p>\"Note that for over 95% of our tenants who have moved out before June, the refund has been processed. Few cases have been pending because if the area is in a containment zone and we are not allowed to go to inspect the properties or simply because landlords have refused to do so,\" the spokesperson said.</p>, <p>Co-founded by Amerandra Sahu, Deepak Dhar, Jagadev and Smruti Parida in 2015, Nestaway provides managed rentals in two formats which include shared living spaces in apartments and villas as full houses ranging from 1BHKs to 4BHKs. Shared spaces are targeted mostly at bachelors and students while the full house format is meant for families.</p>, <p>Nestaway has so far raised around $110 million from investors such as Tiger Global, Epiq Capital, Goldman Sachs, and Chiratae Ventures. It currently claims to service over 70,000 tenants and over 40,000 property owners in 15 cities.</p>, <p>The covid-19 has put a halt on expansion plans of co-living startups forcing them to go into damage control mode. In the last three months, co-living startups have seen a drastic drop in demand and physical occupancy in co-living facilities across cities, as students and young working professionals returned home during the lockdown.</p>, <p><span><a class=\"desktopTxt\" href=\"https://epaper.livemint.com/Home/ArticleView?utm_source=livemintstory&amp;utm_medium=lmstorybottom&amp;utm_campaign=lmstoryref\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to read the Mint ePaper</span>Livemint.com is now on Telegram.<a href=\"https://t.me/livemint\" target=\"_blank\"> Join Livemint channel</a> in your Telegram and stay updated</p>, <p>Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

      "European regulators could approve the first vaccine against Covid-19 this year, after a flurry of trials by drugmakers leading the race showed promising results.</p>, <p>“We are preparing ourselves for that possibility so that we as regulators will be ready,\" Marco Cavaleri, head of anti-infectives and vaccines at the European Medicines Agency, said in an interview Tuesday. “It will be a matter of seeing whether this data could be sufficient for allowing any kind of approval by the end of 2020.\"</p>, <p>The EMA will start working with drugmakers on a rolling review after the summer, according to Cavaleri. Trial data, manufacturing and clinical decisions will be assessed by the regulator in real time to speed up the approval process. The approach should allow any successful vaccine to be officially approved within a matter of days once submitted, Cavaleri said.</p>, <p>Optimism over prospects for Covid-19 jabs is growing after the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc published promising results from early human tests of a shot on Monday. Vaccine partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, as well as China-based CanSino Biologics Inc., also announced early positive data from their vaccine trials. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said the company hopes to be able to start delivering a vaccine by year-end.</p>, <p>The first approved shot will probably be for adults only, as child testing takes longer and kids don’t appear to be as seriously affected by the disease, Cavaleri said. More research is needed on the rate of transmission by children, and the regulator will have to consider the risks and benefits of giving any vaccine to them, he said.</p>, <p><strong>Efficacy Target</strong></p>, <p>Unlike the US Food and Drug Administration, the EMA has declined to put a target on the efficacy needed for a vaccine, opting to wait until more data is available. The FDA has said any candidate shot would need to prevent disease or decrease severity in at least half of those vaccinated to earn approval.</p>, <p>“For the time being it’s very difficult to define any threshold,\" said Cavaleri. “We have to look at the benefit-risk of the vaccines once data become available and this precludes the possibility of being so definitive on what will be a minimal acceptable level of efficacy.\"</p>, <p>The race to get a vaccine approved by the end of the year would also avoid a potential Brexit headache for drugmakers. Starting in January, any shot would need to be approved by both the EMA and the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. A representative for the MHRA said the agency was “prioritizing work to support the development of vaccines and medicines\" to fight the pandemic.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><em>This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

      "Apple Inc said on Tuesday it plans to remove carbon emissions from its entire business, including its products and sprawling supply chain, over the next decade.</p>, <p>The iPhone maker said its global corporate operations such as offices and data centers are already carbon neutral but that it will extend its effort to the thousands of suppliers that contribute to its products.</p>, <p>Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats.</p>, <p>For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed \"scope three\" emissions, which come indirectly from a company's value chain. In Apple's case, this means contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd's Foxconn.</p>, <p>Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million \"U.S.-China Green Fund\" to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects.</p>, <p>The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine.</p>, <p>Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices.</p>, <p>Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund.</p>, <p>Apple's nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as Microsoft Corp, which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies.</p>, <p>Apple's most recent environmental report, covering fiscal 2018, put its carbon footprint at 25.2 million tons.</p>, <p><em>This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

      "<em>It has become fashionable to talk about automation post covid-19. Factories need less people on the floor while services industries contact-less delivery. Nevertheless, there is another reason why manufacturers must adopt automation — the world wants traceability and it is easier to trace a problem when machines are connected and the records digital, said Sandeep Maini, chairman at Maini Group, a diversified manufacturer, during an interview. Excerpts:</em></p>, <p><strong>Post covid-19, even the smaller manufacturing companies are talking of automation. Is this a knee-jerk reaction because of labour shortages?</strong></p>, <p>This is a trigger. Tomorrow, if covid and social distancing goes away, I don’t think these companies will stop the foray into automation. The realisations are well beyond social distancing and migrant labour issues — the realisation that this how things are going to go in the future. We got a good trigger to say let’s make it happen.</p>, <p><strong>What progress has India made in automation thus far?</strong></p>, <p>The first two phases are Enterprise Resource Management (ERP) and automation of systems and software which are used in design or in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining. These are the low hanging fruit — more easily understandable to most of the companies. Lot of systems are now available at low cost. The next phase is Industry 4.0 where machines are seamlessly connected. This is in the initial stages in most companies including us. One must do this not only because it is bringing in a lot of efficiency, removing human errors and streamlining the system, but also because of what the world is asking today in terms of liability issues; around traceability.</p>, <p>If you have digital records, it is easy to trace things down. While many companies would like to adopt Industry 4.0 principles, it is still a challenge because one does not know at what size one must do it; one does not know when it gives you a payback; one also does not know how to make the paradigm shift in the team you are working with because they are so used to working in a legacy manner. New companies would like to adopt the principles from day one whereas legacy companies will do it in phases. We did it in a new plant and decided not to do it in our older plants. The new plant had younger people and the idea was to create a new culture.</p>, <p><strong>Considering India’s demographic how easy will it be to up-skill our workforce for Industry 4.0? And what is the window of time India has?</strong></p>, <p>This is a question which is up in the air. It is discussed at every industry forum, at every government interaction. People have different ways of looking at it — some cynically, some positively. The fact is automation is the future and we have to up-skill. Instead of plotting various scenarios and the timeline by when it could happen, we need to get down to the job. Covid-19 is a trigger to do things much earlier than you wanted to.</p>, <p><strong>What is a good place to start the job?</strong></p>, <p>The strongest area is our ITIs. The government ITIs, from a facility point of view, from a training point of view and from an experience point of view, are outstanding. The challenge is that they are stagnating. They are not moving to the future as fast as they should. They have not made the change to robotics, programming of robots etc. Today when we hire people in our factory, we have to take them through a three-month programme. However, the ITIs should be the home ground for up-skilling.</p>, <p><span><a class=\"desktopTxt\" href=\"https://epaper.livemint.com/Home/ArticleView?utm_source=livemintstory&amp;utm_medium=lmstorybottom&amp;utm_campaign=lmstoryref\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to read the Mint ePaper</span>Livemint.com is now on Telegram.<a href=\"https://t.me/livemint\" target=\"_blank\"> Join Livemint channel</a> in your Telegram and stay updated</p>, <p>Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

      "India's e-commerce business is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% to reach $99 billion by 2024, Goldman Sachs said projecting that Reliance Industries would capture half of the online grocery sales through Facebook.</p>, <p>In a report titled 'Global Internet: e-commerce's steepening curve', Goldman Sachs said the COVID-19 pandemic has driven a doubling of penetration of e-commerce globally with categories such as consumer packaged goods driving as much as three years of penetration growth in three months.</p>, <p>\"We forecast India e-commerce will reach $99 billion by 2024, growing at a 27% CAGR over 2019-24, with grocery and fashion/apparel likely to be the key drivers of incremental growth in our view,\" it said.</p>, <p>Online penetration of retail is expected to reach 10.7% by 2024, versus 4.7% in 2019.</p>, <p>\"The biggest near term theme in India internet, in our view, is the foray of Reliance Industries (India's largest market-cap company with presence across sectors such as energy, telecom, and retail) into e-commerce, and the company's tie-up with WhatsApp for online grocery,\" it said.</p>, <p>Facebook has picked up a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, the subsidiary of RIL that houses the country's youngest but biggest telecom company as well as an array of apps. RIL's e-commerce venture, JioMart plans to use Facebook's WhatsApp to connect local grocery stores with customers.</p>, <p>Goldman Sachs said Bigbasket and Grofers accounted for more than 80% of the market in 2019 in online grocery.</p>, <p>Online grocery has been growing at over 50% year-on-year for the last couple of years, but with the outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in shift to online, and the recent entry of RIL, the growth will accelerate to 81% CAGR during 2019-24, it said.</p>, <p>\"We believe RIL's partnership with Facebook could result in the company becoming a market leader in the online grocery space, with more than 50% share by 2024,\" it said. \"Having said that, we do see grocery as a large category for two or more players to co-exist over time.\"</p>, <p>Growth in India's e-commerce, the brokerage said, is likely to come from better penetration into categories such as grocery/FMCG, improving payment ecosystem and ease of shopping through WhatsApp etc.</p>, <p>\"We expect non-grocery e-commerce penetration to see a sharp increase of 500 basis points over the next two years to reach 16.1% by 2021,\" Goldman Sachs said adding the last 500 basis points of the increase took four years.</p>, <p>While online penetration in categories such as consumer electronics is fairly high at about 40% as of 2019, there exists signiﬁcant growth in categories like apparel, appliances, health and personal care, where online penetration in India remains materially lower when compared with peers such as China.</p>, <p>\"As far as incremental growth in e-commerce is concerned, we expect grocery to be the biggest driver with 40% contribution to incremental e-commerce GMV (gross merchandise volume) between 2019 and 2024,\" it said.</p>, <p>Grocery in India is a $380 billion category as of 2019, making up for 60% of the total retail market.</p>, <p>\"However, online penetration currently stands at less than 0.5% (absolute size $2 billion), one of the least among categories,\" it said projecting the online grocery market in India to grow 20x over the next 5 years, to reach $29 billion in value (5.1% penetration) by 2024.</p>, <p>It saw a higher acceptance of online purchases among Indian consumers, especially since COVID-19, as one of the key drivers.</p>, <p>Other drivers include RIL's foray into the space leveraging its large ofﬂine distribution capabilities and ability to order groceries through WhatsApp - a platform with more than 400 million users in India.</p>, <p>\"Overall, we forecast online grocery orders to grow from 300,000 per day in 2019, to more than 5 million per day by 2024,\" it said.</p>, <p>Goldman Sachs said the coronavirus pandemic has driven an acceleration in the adoption of countless technologies and consumer behaviours, chief among them being e-commerce.</p>, <p>\"What started at first with panic buying, hoarding and nest feathering out of necessity has turned into an array of adaptations that have driven e-commerce penetration from 16% of retail spending in the US in 1Q19 to over 40% in May driven by year- over-year growth of nearly 70%,\" it said.</p>, <p>Globally, e-commerce would grow 24%, it added.</p>, <p><span><a class=\"desktopTxt\" href=\"https://epaper.livemint.com/Home/ArticleView?utm_source=livemintstory&amp;utm_medium=lmstorybottom&amp;utm_campaign=lmstoryref\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to read the Mint ePaper</span>Livemint.com is now on Telegram.<a href=\"https://t.me/livemint\" target=\"_blank\"> Join Livemint channel</a> in your Telegram and stay updated</p>, <p>Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Health, Hygiene and Nutrition constituting 80% of our portfolio delivered healthy mid-single digit domestic consumer growth. The integration of GSK-CH’s nutrition business with us was done seamlessly with good performance on both growth and margins,\" the company said in an earnings release.</p>, <p>HUL’s quarterly earnings are a bellwether for India’s consumption economy.</p>, <p>Sales of its detergents, soaps, packaged tea and shampoos that reach millions of households help gauge consumer demand which took a beating as the pandemic prompted consumers to disproportionally spend on categories such as health and hygiene while postponing beauty and personal care spends. Moreover, India’s protracted lockdown caused disruptions for several makers of consumer products.</p>, <p>Standalone segment revenue at the company's food and refreshment business held strong, posting over 50% growth, while beauty and personal care was down 12%. Segment revenue across home care was down too during the quarter.</p>, <p>Among several categories that the company operates in, skin cleansing led by Lifebuoy delivered strong double-digit growth across formats as covid-19 drove sales of personal hygiene products. \"We have significantly stepped up capacities in both hand wash and hand sanitizers to meet the consumer needs,\" the company said. </p>, <p>Moreover, in-home consumption of packaged foods helped foods, tea and coffee deliver strong performance with double digit growths.</p>, <p>Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, HUL, said while agility in operations, excellence in execution, and a strong balance sheet helped the company in a challenging quarter, near-term demand outlook remains uncertain.</p>, <p>“While constraints continue due to restrictions in several parts of the country and the near-term demand outlook remains uncertain, we remain well positioned to drive competitive, profitable, and responsible growth. The long-term structural opportunity of FMCG in India also remains intact,\" he said.</p>, <p><span><a class=\"desktopTxt\" href=\"https://epaper.livemint.com/Home/ArticleView?utm_source=livemintstory&amp;utm_medium=lmstorybottom&amp;utm_campaign=lmstoryref\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to read the Mint ePaper</span>Livemint.com is now on Telegram.<a href=\"https://t.me/livemint\" target=\"_blank\"> Join Livemint channel</a> in your Telegram and stay updated</p>, <p>Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.
